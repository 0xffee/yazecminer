Yet Another ZEC Miner, CPU miner for https://z.cash/

Reimplementation of xenoncat/Tromp algorithm, just to understand
it better by myself.   Performs from 15% to 20% worse then Tromp's equi1.
It's single-threaded on purpose, and it's not so memory optimized.
The aim was the pure C miner with no dependencies, that works of either
little-endian or big-endian platform (ultrasparc is so pathetic)

Code used:
- BLAKE2b reference implementation from RFC 7693
- BLAKE2b optimized for SSE4.1/SSE2, taken from equihash by John Tromp

- SHA-256 taken from cgminer by Con Kolivas
    https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/
- JSON parser by Serge A. Zaitsev

How to run it:
   ./yazecminer.exe -l eu1-zcash.flypool.org -u {workername} -d 3
